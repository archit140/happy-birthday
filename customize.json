A few years ago, I never imagined Iâ€™d write something like this for anyone, but you changed everything. In the last three years, youâ€™ve shown me what  love feels like, and I canâ€™t thank you enough for being the most precious person in my life.

Many birthday wishes are coming your way, but I promise to make each year even more special for you. I can't wait to see you, hold you close, and shower you with endless kisses! ðŸ˜˜ðŸ’•

Happy Birthday, My Forever! ðŸ¥°ðŸŽ‰"
